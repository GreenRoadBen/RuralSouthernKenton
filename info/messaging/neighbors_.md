# Neighbor Messaging Center  

Talking to your neighbors about these topics is the most impactful action that can be done other than showing up to meetings and voting for candidates that authenticaly share values of protecting the land and families of Rural Kenton County.

## Who, Why, How?
The best neighbors to engage are those who live on the same road as you. You travel the same paths, enjoy the same views, and will be impacted in similar ways if the land is allowed to be changed in **land-use** or **zoning**.  
You can use pay them a visit in person, or write them a letter via mail. If you are unsure of the exact mail number on their post box, you can use the Kenton County PVA site to look it up on their map.  
[see Maps section](/info/maps/)
 

## Engagement of Neighbors 
Customize your letter to depending on which "Focus Area" you and your neighbors are impacted. 
* Awareness of the situation is the first priority to communicate, and how personal it is to you.
* Providing a path to action is the next priority. Suggest how to be informed, such as getting together to talk about it or some other community events that are happening for that same purpose.
