Ownership may be individuals, trusts, corporations, or others. 
By KY Law, property owners must list a non-PO Box mailing address as part of their ownership. That required information can be further used to identify the actual owners.  

Additionally LINKGIS is available as well with greater advanced searching and layers to add to the maps. Click to browse and review
