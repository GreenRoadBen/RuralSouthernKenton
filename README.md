## Property Maps 
Often KY county clerk offices offer a service of the Property Value Administrator to see property lines and ownership information (by law). 

Ownership may be individuals, trusts, corporations, or others. 
By KY Law, they must list a non-PO Box mailing address as part of their ownership, so that information can be additionally used for identification.
