> In October 2024, the Fiscal Court approved a Site Readiness Initiative (SRI) for Manufacturing, identifying our rural surroundings as Focus Area #1. Land from Walton-Nicholson north to Maher, west along Banklick Road. This includes the stream and the railroad. See their published map and description attached.

Officials heard objections to lack of communication, the process, and the plans. For our Area, this was not enough. In his latest letter of 3-10-2025 to residents, Judge Executive Knochelmann has decided to prioritize developing and expanding Focus Area #1.

> Happening Now. 
> Beyond the initial 5,200 acres, he now plans to start talking to individual landowners in an additional 900 acres closer to Walton-Nicholson. He says nothing of the surrounding rural community affected who also have a big stake in this future. We need to have a voice at the table on whatever plans are proposed; his timeline is plans to Fiscal Court this Springâ€¦. now!

> In October 2024, the Fiscal Court approved a Site Readiness Initiative (SRI) for Manufacturing, identifying our rural surroundings as Focus Area #2. This included land from Walton/ Boone County along US 25 to the Grant County line; west of US 25 over I-75 to Boone County line; and originally east of US 25 to a border unspecified. See their published map and description attached.  
> 
> Current situation through March. 
> Planning and Development Services (PDS) held public meetings at Piner School and Simon Kenton in February where over 300 attended.  At Piner, many were turned away. Officials heard objections to lack of communication, the process, and the plans. Then so many of us attended a KC Planning Commission meeting that officials opened an overflow room. Well-prepared residents spoke for over an hour, objecting to the SRI plans and requesting a pause to bring our voices to the table. It has worked, so far. 
> 
> In his latest letter of March 10, 2025, Judge Executive Knochelmann said he decided to do just that as well as stop promoting a new I-75 interchange and to revisit the SRI plans. He plans to talk to individual landowners yet our rural community as a whole has a big stake in this future..
